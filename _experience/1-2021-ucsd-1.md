• Collaborated and implemented an AutoML framework using PyTorch for decomposing object features into domain-specific &
class-specific representations using neural architecture search approaches to solve the problem of domain adaptation
• Optimized the framework and employed ResNet architectures with supervised & semi-supervised settings, & achieved a
state-of-the-art accuracy of 87.5%
