• Tasked on quantifying the distribution of magnetic susceptibility within brain MRI images using deep neural networks
• Implemented and boosted the accuracy of the U-Net model built using TensorFlow to 91% by leveraging the generated data
with 3D geometrical shapes for training, & improved the model by applying structural similarity index loss function
