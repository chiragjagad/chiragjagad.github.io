I am a senior-year student pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology at [Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering, Mumbai University](https://www.djsce.ac.in/).

My research interest lies in Deep Learning, and I love demystifying the magic of neural networks. I am currently working with [Prof. Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/) at the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), on feature learning by domain decomposing using Differentiable Architecture Search approaches. Furthermore, I also have a strong interest in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence in the medical domain excites me the most. I am also working with [Prof. Tapan Gandhi](https://tapankgandhi.com/) and [Sapna Mishra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sapna-mishra-0a378653/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) on the dipole inversion problem for Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping using Deep Learning. My junior-year college project also revolves around the medical domain as well, where I and my team have developed a [Smart Healthcare System](https://chiragjagad.github.io/publication/Smart%20Healthcare%20System%20to%20Predict%20Aliments%20Based%20on%20Preliminary%20Symptoms) to solve complicated healthcare challenges. I am also working with my college professor [Prof. Neha Katre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neha-katre-53a9111a) on improvising feature extraction for event detection in video analytics and optimizing the process.

I am also inclined toward developing software, and I do have expertise in Full Stack Web Development. In the past, I have worked as a Full Stack Web Developer at [DotSyndicate](https://www.dotsyndicate.com/), where I developed an end-to-end admin dashboard for an African E-commerce company.

I believe in knowledge transfer, and I am passionate about sharing knowledge. I serve as the Research and Development Lead at [DJ Init. AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/35949740/admin/), where I teach concepts related to Artificial Intelligence and promote research. I am also a part of the Mentor-Mentee group at my college, where I serve as a mentor and guide my juniors. Additionally, I am also grateful to be the Gold Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador ([MLSA](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/)) and one of the community leaders. At MLSA, I get tons of opportunities to enhance my knowledge and share my knowledge.
