I am a first-year graduate student pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science from the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology at [Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering, Mumbai University](https://www.djsce.ac.in/).

My research interest lies in Deep Learning, and I love demystifying the magic of neural networks. I worked with [Prof. Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/) at the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), on feature learning by domain decomposing using Differentiable Architecture Search approaches. Furthermore, I also have a strong interest in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence in the medical domain excites me the most. I worked with [Prof. Tapan Gandhi](https://tapankgandhi.com/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) on the dipole inversion problem for Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping using Deep Learning. My junior-year college project also revolved around the medical domain as well, where I and my team developed a [Smart Healthcare System](https://chiragjagad.github.io/publication/Smart%20Healthcare%20System%20to%20Predict%20Aliments%20Based%20on%20Preliminary%20Symptoms) to solve complicated healthcare challenges. As an undergraduate research assistant, I worked with my college professor [Prof. Neha Katre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neha-katre-53a9111a) on an intelligent video surveillance system wherein I developed a novel keyframe extraction technique that is currently in the process of patent.

I am also inclined toward developing software, and I do have expertise in Full Stack Web Development. In the past, I have worked as a Full Stack Web Developer at [DotSyndicate](https://www.dotsyndicate.com/), where I developed an end-to-end admin dashboard for an African E-commerce company.

I believe in knowledge transfer, and I am passionate about sharing knowledge. I served as the Research and Development Lead at [DJ Init. AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/35949740/admin/), where I taught concepts related to Artificial Intelligence and promote research. I was also a part of the Mentor-Mentee group at my college, where I served as a mentor and guided my juniors. Additionally, I led the global community of Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador as the Gold Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador ([MLSA](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/)). At MLSA, I get tons of opportunities to enhance my knowledge and share it with others.
