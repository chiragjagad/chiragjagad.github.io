## Description:

- Built a robust Multilayer Perceptron model using the Federated Machine Learning approach providing an accuracy of 96% for Bank Churn Prediction and solved the problem of the imbalanced dataset used by upsampling it
- Presented a deep analysis of the advantages of Federated Machine Learning concerning the accuracy, transmission time, and computation cost
